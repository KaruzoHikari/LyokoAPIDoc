# Welcome to the LyokoAPI Docs

LyokoAPI (LAPI) is a project that aims to connect Applications with a Code Lyoko theme to each other, primarily in the form of Plugins.

Currently, the target language is C# (Framework 3.5 for Unity compatibility).<br>
Do contact us if you want to make an API in another language, we'd love to contribute!
