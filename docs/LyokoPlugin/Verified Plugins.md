#Introduction
This list contains plugins that have been verified as LAPI-Compliant.<br>
That means that they follow the rules we have set, and that they don't contain malicious code.<br>
Even if your plugin complies to the rules we have set,<br>
LAPI Developers hold all rights to deny a Plugin to be added to Plugin List<br>

Do verify if the version of the plugin you're downloading is in the range of supported versions, for we've only checked those.<br>

Regardless, we don't take any responsibility if it breaks.<br>
